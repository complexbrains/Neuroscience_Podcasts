# Neuroscience_Podcasts

Here I gathered the podcasts that I like to listen and enjoy the general topics in Neuroscience. Working in a specific field for such a long time, sometimes blinds our perception of looking into things from different perspectives and scientific aspects. I always have so much respect to the people who use metaphors and examples from other scientific fields to explain things in neuroscience which makes things easier to understand or allow you to create link across different scientific fields. Hence it helps to you to investigate the ways of implementing methods across disciplines to solve very complex methods sometimes using very easy applications from another scientific field. Therefore it is sometimes helpful to distract ourselves with other research going on under different subfields. Podcasts are one of the most effective ways of having this chance because the majority of us either use transportations to commute from home to work or spend some time (hopefully several times a week) doing some workouts, so there is always the possibility to find time to listen to such podcasts... Anyways long story short, I will list some podcasts that I listen and enjoy, hope you find them useful too...

[Unsupervised Thinking](http://unsupervisedthinkingpodcast.blogspot.com/) is a interactie podscasts run as if they are journal clubs and run by a bunch of early career researchers on neuroscience, artificial intelligence and general science


[Brain Inspired](https://braininspired.co/podcast/) is a series of podcasts on neuroscience and AI, machine learning and how brain functioning could lead to a better understanding and implementation of AI methodologies. 


[Brain Science Podcast](http://brainsciencepodcast.com/) run by Ginger Campel, MD, on mind, body, philosopy, language, emotion in a way all the aspects of brain research.
