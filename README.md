# Neuroscience_Podcasts

Here I gathered the podcasts about the general topics in Neuroscience that I like to listen to and enjoy. Working in a specific field for such a long time, sometimes blinds our perception of looking into things from different perspectives and scientific aspects. I always have so much respect for the people who use metaphors and examples from other scientific fields to explain things in neuroscience which makes things easier to understand or allow you to create links across different scientific fields. Hence it helps you to investigate the ways of implementing methods across disciplines to solve very complex methods sometimes using very easy applications from another scientific field. Therefore it is sometimes helpful to distract ourselves with other research going on under different subfields to get a grip of scientific understanding and approach better. Podcasts are one of the most effective ways of having this chance because the majority of us either use transportations to commute from home to work or spend some time (hopefully several times a week) doing some workouts, so there is always a possibility to find a time to listen to such podcasts... Anyways long story short, I will list some podcasts that I listen and enjoy, hope you find them useful too...
